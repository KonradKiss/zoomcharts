--------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.4
 * Worked around a bug in Windows Phone IE when using display scaling (custom DPI).
 * Fixed additional IE9 compatibility issue.

 NetChart
 * Default `focusNodeTailExpansionRadius` set to `null` which instructs the chart to use the same
   value as specified in `focusNodeExpansionRadius`.
 * Focus node layout will more correctly respond to dynamically changing settings.

 TimeChart
 * Improved chart behavior when working with completely empty dataset.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.3
 * Improved IE9 support by correctly wrapping all `console` calls.
 * Fixed some invalid comments in the documentation on anonymous types.
 * Fixed issue on IE where the charts prevented clicks on browser scrollbar.

 GeoChart
 * Fixed bugs with positioning locked nodes with dynamic layout.
 * No longer using `worldCopyJump` option for Leaflet map, instead the default `navigation.maxBounds`
   value has been updated to not allow horizontal scroll outside the chart area.
 * Updated the bundled Leaflet.js to version 0.7.7.
 * Nodes that are loaded from GeoJSON now have `data.shapeFeature` and `data.shapeGeometry` 
   properties that contain the original data objects.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.1
 * Reduced default values of `area.minHeight` and `area.minWidth` from 165px to 50px.
 * Improved info popup and context menu positioning when using chart-on-chart.

 TimeChart and FacetChart
 * Bugfixes for value labels.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.0
 * The version history in the documentation will be added from now on to new and updated settings 
   and API members.
 * Documentation updates and small bugfixes.

 TimeChart and FacetChart
 * Value labels can now be added to the chart (e.g. showing the actual value on top of each column).
 * Series configuration can now be extended with additional data using `extra` property. This data
   can then be used in the event handlers.
 * New setting `info.position`. Can be specified as `outside` to allow info popup to be rendered
   above or below the chart. Useful for when the chart is very small.

 NetChart
 * Fixed node menu when three-finger click was used on Chrome/OSX.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.0
 * All charts now have `replaceSettings()` method that can be used to remove settings that are
   arrays or dictionaries (such as TimeChart series and value axis).
 * Dragging the pointer around and releasing at the initial location no longer triggers a click.
 * Labels can now contain multiple sequential `<br>` tags.
 * Better mouse wheel handling, most notably for Firefox where it did not work in certain situations.

 GeoChart
 * Leaflet.js is no longer embedded in zoomcharts.js. Instead it is loaded asynchronously when
   the chart is first created. Note that GeoChart.leaflet() API method can now return `null` 
   while the async load is in progress.
 * Updated the bundled Leaflet.js to version 0.7.5.

 FacetChart
 * `facetAxis.maxUnitWidth` setting now behaves as expected.

 TimeChart
 * `localization.calendar.week.dow` can now be used to specify the first day of the week (default is
   Monday).
 * All week format strings have been changed to correctly use ISO week number and year.

 NetChart
 * `onHoverChange` event is now called less frequently when hovering link labels.
 * If the selection is changed while a node is being dragged, the chart now behaves correctly.
 * Navigation modes overhauled for a more intuitive behavior, especially for "focusnodes".
 * New setting default value: focusNodeTailExpansionRadius changed from 0.3 to 2.
 * New setting default value: focusAutoFadeout changed from true to false.
 * New setting: autoUnfocus. Governs what happens when a user wants to focus more than "numberOfFocusNodes".
 * Fixed setting focusAutoFadeout - now actually works.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.9.1
 TimeChart
 * Fixes use of `seriesDefault`.

 FacetChart
 * Fixes use of `seriesDefault`.
 * Added `toolbar.logScale` setting to allow easy removal of Lin/Log button from the toolbar.

 PieChart
 * Fixed mouse/touch interactions in fullscreen mode.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.9.0
 * Improvements how mouse and touch is handled when the pointers are moved outside the chart area.
 * Most gradients are now calculated using LAB color scheme which results in better colors.
 * Improvements to documentation.
 * Event handlers now are passed two arguments - the mouse event and the event arguments.

 Time chart
 * Vertical time markers (milestones) can now be added to the chart.
 * Fixed issues when milliseconds were used as the display unit.

 Net chart
 * Rectangle shape for nodes is now built in without the need to provide custom delegates.
 * Fixed displaying links in legend.
 * Zoom slider control can now be hidden by setting `toolbar.zoomControl=false`.
 * `onHoverChange` event is now called less frequently when hovering node labels.
 * The `contentsFunction` for `nodeMenu` and `linkMenu` can now return DOM element, not just string.
 
--------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.4
 * Fixed issue when using HTML tags within label texts could hang the script execution.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.3
 * Fixed number formatting where zeroes could be omitted.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.2
 * Added support for OEM licenses.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.1
 Pie chart
 * `selection()` method modified enabling user code to modify the returned array.

--------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.0
 * Performance improvements.
 * Many improvements to the documentation.
 * All charts now include default visual dark themes (on black background).
 * The objects on charts (such as nodes or slices) can be used as drag-n-drop targets.
 * Long press is no longer cancelled as soon as the pointer moves.
 * Better support for zoom/scroll/pan on mobile devices (specifically on Android/Chrome).

 Breaking changes
 * PieChart - specifying `slice.styleFunction` no longer prevents default slice label from being
   generated - instead it can be set to `null` manually within the `slice.styleFunction`.

 Geo chart
 * Fixed positioning issue when using `title` on geo chart.
 * API method `updateStyle` can now be passed the IDs of objects to achieve better performance.

 Time chart
 * `info.advanced.contentsFunction` is now passed the time range and can override the header.
 * Fixed `nameLegend` setting not working. Show 'Unnamed' by default for series without names.
 * Data object is now cloned in certain situations to allow it to be reused (for example, in
   multiple charts) even if timezone offsets or type conversion modifies the data.
 * Chart is automatically redrawn when new data is added to it using API.
 * The current time marker is no longer included in the scrollable region by default.
 * Even/odd color styling made more consistent when multiple stacks are used.
 * Display errors if invalid time units are used.
 * Fixed minorTimeBalloon rendering.
 * Added `count` aggregation method.
 * Fixed logarithmic scale when using stacked series.

 Facet chart
 * Fixed `nameLegend` setting not working. Show 'Unnamed' by default for series without names.
 * Scroll buttons have larger responsive area on touch devices.
 * Multi-line and rotated labels are now rendered with ellipsis when needed.

 Pie chart
 * Specifying `slice.styleFunction` no longer prevents default slice label from being
   generated - instead it can be set to `null` manually within the `slice.styleFunction`.
 * `slice.labelStyle` moved to `slice.style.label` and `slice.insideLabelStyle` to 
   `slice.style.insideLabel`. Streamlined the label style application.
 * `slice.label` now contains the whole label style instead of just the text - to set the text
   use `slice.label.text`.
 * Icons that are slow to download are now displayed as soon as they are available.

 Net chart
 * Hovering on node/link label or custom item now is treated as hover on the node/link.
 * Clicking node or link label or custom item now raises `onClick` event and populates the 
   `clickItem` property.
 * More consistent behavior on which nodes are hidden when focus node navigation is used.
 * Automatic scaling based on zoom can now be specified for links and nodes separately.
 * Added `invisible` setting to links and nodes that enable performant way of hiding them.
 * API method `updateStyle` can now be passed the IDs of objects to achieve better performance.
 * Improvements to the hierarchy layout.
